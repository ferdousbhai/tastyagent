# tasty-agent: A TastyTrade MCP Server

## Overview

A Model Context Protocol server for interacting with TastyTrade brokerage accounts. This server enables Large Language Models to monitor portfolios, analyze positions, and execute trades through the TastyTrade platform.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- A TastyTrade account

## Installation

Install uv if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

We will use `uvx` to directly run tasty-agent:

```bash
uvx tasty-agent
```

### Authentication

The server requires TastyTrade credentials. For security, these are set up via command line and stored in your system's keyring (Keychain on macOS, Windows Credential Manager on Windows, or similar secure storage on other platforms):

```bash
uvx tasty-agent setup
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tastytrade": {
      "command": "path/to/uvx/command/uvx",
      "args": ["tasty-agent"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Scheduled trades will only execute while Claude Desktop is running. When Claude Desktop is closed, the server shuts down and trades are not executed.

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx tasty-agent
```

For logs, check:

- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log`

## Development

For local development testing:

1. Use the MCP inspector (see [Debugging](#debugging))
2. Test using Claude Desktop with this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tastytrade": {
      "command": "path/to/uv/command/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "path/to/tasty-agent",
        "run",
        "tasty-agent"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
